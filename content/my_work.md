## Communities

### Česko.Digital
[Česko.Digital](https://cesko.digital/) is a community of specialists from many fields, from IT to project management to marketing, with various background. 
NGO, public administration, business, and more. 
We guide non-profit organizations and public administrations through the process of digital transformation, and our goal is for them to be able to use the potential of digital technologies and thus increase their impact. \
My role is called Community Experience Lead - I take care of the backgroudn processes, community operations, community building, and the overall positive experience of our community members. \
I am also one of the [administrators](https://diskutuj.digital/u/anezkamll/summary) of the Česko.Digital's open discussion forum [Diskutuj.Digital](https://diskutuj.digital/).

### PyLadies
[PyLadies](https://pyladies.com/) is an international initiative which focuses on bringing more women to IT and IT to women and to become active participants in the Python open-source community. 
In the Czech Republic, our main activities are Python courses and workshops for beginners and I am one of the organizers of those events. \
As an alumni, I joined [PyLadies CZ](https://pyladies.cz/) in 2017 as an organizer of local programming courses and workshops. \
Currently, I support "new generation" of organizers, handle socail media, and represent our community at various events.

### Czech Python Community
In addition to PyLadies, I am also an active member of the Czech Python Community.

## Events

### Global Donut Day in Prague: 3 Faces of Just Transition
An environmentally-focused event organized by [Doughnut Czechia](https://www.doughnutczechia.cz/) and [Pábení](https://www.pabeni.cz/) at the occasion of [Global Donut Day](https://doughnuteconomics.org/globaldonutday). 
The goal was to interconnect representatives from business, non-profit and state administration who work or want to work to ensure a good life within the limits of the planet for all Czechs. \
I was hired to take care of the event production. \

### PyCon CZ 2016 - 2023
I attended the very first PyCon CZ 2015 in Brno and that was a beginning of my long-lasting relationship with Czech Python community.
I was volunteering at PyCon CZ 2016 and 2017, and in 2018 I joined the core organizing team. Besides the group tasks I was responsible mainly for social media, and in 2023 also for coordinating onsite volunteers. \

### PyLadies CZ Courses and Workshops
I organized several semestral courses for beginners, and follow-up courses (e. g. Linux Administration, Python Libraries). 
Although I am no longer active as a main organizer, I still participate in organizing PyWorkings - day-long narrowly focused workshops (e.g. Git, Data Analysis with Python, Linux for beginners). 

### SolarWinds Meetups
As a part of the SolarWinds Brno team, I was responsible for branding, meetups, and other community events until October 2020.  \
[SolarWinds Meetup Website](https://www.solarwindsmeetup.com/location/brno_cze/)

My work covered overall organization of small or mid-size local meetups, and also production of bigger international gatherings, such as: \

## Projects

### We Teach Online
The We Teach Online ([Učíme online](https://www.ucimeonline.cz/o-nas/)) project was created in the spring of 2020 as a community activity of the non-profit organization Česko.Digital in cooperation with the GUG.cz community, GEG ČR, Microsoft Student Training Center, Microsoft Innovative Educator Experts, Google ČR, Microsoft ČR and American Academy. \
I sterted in January 2021 as a Project Manager and after several months moved to the coordinating and supportig role for a volunteer team who took over the main operation of the project.
In 2022, we handed over the project partly to People in Need and partly to the National Pedagogical Institute of the Czech Republic.
