## Events

### 3 tváře spravedlivé tranzice
An environmentally-focused event organized by [Doughnut Czechia](https://www.doughnutczechia.cz/) and [Pábení](https://www.pabeni.cz/) \
at the occasion of [Global Donut Day](https://doughnuteconomics.org/globaldonutday). 
The goal was to interconnect representatives from business, non-profit and state administration who work or want to work to ensure a good life within the limits of the planet for all Czechs. \
I was hired to take care of the event production.

## Projects

### Učíme online
The [Učíme online](https://www.ucimeonline.cz/o-nas/) project was created in the spring of 2020 as a community activity of the non-profit organization Česko.Digital in cooperation with the GUG.cz community, GEG ČR, Microsoft Student Training Center, Microsoft Innovative Educator Experts, Google ČR, Microsoft ČR and American Academy. \
I sterted in January 2021 as a Project Manager and after several months moved to the coordinating and supportig role for a volunteer team who took over the main operation of the project.
In 2022, we handed over the project partly to People in Need and partly to the National Pedagogical Institute of the Czech Republic.
