I dedicate most of my my working and free time to communities -⁠ I am lucky that what I enjoy is also part of my livelihood.
Community operations, community building, community processes - you name it.

In addition to that, I orginaze events of various types and sizes and occasionaly jump in as a project manager if needed.

Currently, my main occupation is community ops for [Česko.Digital](https://cesko.digital/), where I take care of the whole community, its members and background processes.

At the same time, I am active in the Czech Python community, either with the Brno [PyLadies](https://pyladies.cz/), in the organizational team of the conference [PyCon CZ](https://cz.pycon.org/2023/), or as a boaed member of the non-profit [Pyvec](https://pyvec.org/).
